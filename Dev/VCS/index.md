description: Version or Revision Control Systems are used to manage source code
...

**Version control** [🡆 VC] is used to manage information changes. This
information comes in form of documents, computer programs, software sources,
large web sites and others. Changes are usually identified by a number (e.g.
1.0, 1.1, ..) or letter code (A, B, ..), termed the "revision number", or
simply "revision".  The terms "version control", "revision control", "revision
control system" (RCS), version control system [🡆 VCS] or "source control" are
synonymous. This and subsequent documents refer to this general concept.
However there is a specific implementation under the same name [🡆 GNU-RCS]
which is not covered.

Recently a special kind of [🡆 VCS]/ RCS emerged the **Distributed Version
Control Systems** ([🡆 DVCS]) or respective **Distributed Revision Control
Systems** (DRCS).  While [🡆 Arch], [🡆 Monotone], and [🡆 Darcs] existed for some
time only recently [🡆 Git] or [🡆 Mercurial] made [🡆 DVCS]/DRCS popular.
